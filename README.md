<h3>üìëLesson Plan</h3>

- **Step 1: We start by introducing the lesson's objective and grouping our students, assigning one news article to each group.**
  
- **Step 2: Each group will then use ChatGPT 4.0 to simplify their article. They'll ensure the content is understandable to younger audiences while maintaining its core message. This step not only enhances reading comprehension but also encourages critical thinking.**

- **Step 3: Moving on, students will use the Leonardo AI application to create visuals related to their simplified articles. This encourages creativity and helps students understand the importance of visual aids in communication.**

- **Step 4: With ElevenLabs, each group transforms their simplified text into audio. This introduces students to text-to-speech technology, adding an auditory layer to their presentations.**

- **Step 5: Finally, students will combine their simplified articles, images, and audio into a cohesive multimedia presentation. This comprehensive activity not only solidifies their understanding of the topic but also polishes their public speaking and technical skills.**

<br>

Each group will present their work, allowing for peer feedback and teacher evaluation. We assess based on the simplicity and accuracy of the content, creativity of the images, quality of the audio, and presentation skills. This lesson plan not only teaches language and digital literacy but also fosters creativity, critical thinking, and technological proficiency. By integrating AI tools into the classroom, we prepare our students for a future where technology and communication go hand in hand.

<h3>
  
```
ChatGPT
```

</h3>

+ **Function:** Advanced language model by OpenAI for text understanding and generation.

+ **Purpose in Lesson:** Simplifies complex news articles to enhance student comprehension and summarization skills.

+ **Example Use:** Simplifying the story of Fubao the panda. Converts complex narratives into simpler summaries suitable for presentations, e.g., "Fubao, a panda, tried to climb over the fences at her zoo to escape. She was caught and brought back by her caretaker, Grandpa Kang. Now, she stays inside while her enclosure is being fixed. She has two siblings, Huibao and Luibao."

<h3>

```
Leonardo AI
```

</h3>

+ **Function:** Digital tool for creating images.
  
+ **Purpose in Lesson:** Enhances visual literacy by allowing students to create images that complement the text.
  
+ **Example Use:** Students create visual representations of key events from the article about Fubao, such as her escape attempt and interaction with Grandpa Kang, to support visual storytelling and emotional connection.

<h3>

```
ElevenLabs
```

</h3>

+ **Function:** Text-to-speech technology.

+ **Purpose in Lesson:** Converts simplified text into audio to support auditory learning and enhance presentation skills.

+ **Example Use:** After text simplification and image creation, students use ElevenLabs to produce audio narratives of the article. Choices of voice and tone (e.g., soothing for Grandpa Kang) enhance engagement and storytelling depth.

Our goal is to enhance our middle school students' comprehension, summarization, and presentation skills. By integrating technology, we aim to create an engaging learning experience that prepares them for the digital age. We'll be utilizing three powerful tools: ChatGPT 4.0, Leonardo, and ElevenLabs, alongside carefully selected news articles. These tools will help us simplify complex texts, create related images, and convert texts into engaging audio presentations.

## üçÄ Rationale

#### Q1 What are the unique advantages of using this tool for English learning or teaching? Identify the benefits this tool offers, focusing on concrete examples that highlight these advantages in practice.

The first unique advantage is that AI tools provide personalized and adaptive learning experiences. Since authentic materials were not created for educational purposes, it was challenging to use them directly in teaching. However, ChatGPT offers personalized language practice. For instance, ChatGPT can customize articles to students' proficiency levels, offering immediate feedback and explanations. Moreover, students can personalize their learning by creating their own materials using tools like LeonardoAI and Elevenlabs. This means even beginners can engage in practicing English. Another advantage is that cooperative learning is facilitated through interaction among learners, enabling scaffolding among them.

#### Q2 How do you envision this tool evolving or impacting English teaching methods in the future? Speculate on the future implications of this tool, including a detailed vision of how it might develop or be integrated into innovative teaching strategies.

In the future, AI will radically transform English teaching. Personalized learning will become the norm. 
In particular, in the field of English writing, since AI Chatbots have emerged that write with perfect grammar and perfect logic, there will be little meaning in grading the writing results. Therefore, when evaluating English writing, we should evaluate the English writing process, not the product.
Since AI will become a tool that must coexist in all educational processes, we believe that rather than blindly excluding it from the educational field, we should change the evaluation method and conduct a lot of research on how AI can be utilized in the educational context.
By embracing AI, we can significantly enhance the educational experience, making English learning more effective, engaging, and tailored to individual needs.

#### Q3 Can this tool be used to facilitate collaboration among students or between students and teachers? How? Explore the tool‚Äôs collaborative features, providing detailed instructions or a step-by-step guide on how these can be used for group projects or discussions.

Each tool from ChatGPT, Leonardo AI, and ElevenLabs can foster collaboration among students or between students and teachers. For example, ChatGPT allows students to brainstorm ideas for assignments and provide feedback to each other, suggesting improvements to the project. Each student can summarize one's own article and share the summary with each other. In that process, Ss can discuss or brainstorm which summary is suitable. With Leonardo AI, each student contributes an idea for a scene or character. In English classes, students can use Leonardo AI to create visual interpretations of the story or text they are studying through discussion. ElevenLabs enables students to conduct pronunciation practice sessions in groups. For instance, through mock conversations, students support each other by speaking sentences and providing feedback.

#### Q4 What are the potential challenges or limitations of using this tool in an English learning or teaching context? Analyze any drawbacks, suggesting practical solutions or workarounds with detailed explanations.
There was a problem with synchronizing AI-generated scripts and AI-made videos; the content did not always align properly. Therefore, it is advisable for teachers to thoroughly create and edit the content before letting AI avatars present it. 

Using Leonardo AI to create images can result in each child producing distinct images. This might lead to a lack of consistency and unity when collaborating to create a single news piece. Additionally, problems can arise when generating images based solely on text without understanding the context. For example, if asked to draw Korean food like "altang," it might produce an image like this.
